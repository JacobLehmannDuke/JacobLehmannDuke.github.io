# Hello
Welcome to my very recently-constructed website! I will update this as I learn more about GitHub, have more free time, and have more to post, but for now, you can revel in the fact that this page no longer says "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."

I grew up in Berkeley, CA, attending the wonderful but uninspiringly-named The College Preparatory School for high school. I was in the Williams College Class of 2024, where I majored in Mathematics and minored in Jewish Studies. I was also captain of the cross country team, and my some might deem my use of Strava so extensive as to be sufficient for course credit.

I am now a second year PhD student in pure math at Dartmouth College, where I am learning algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and how to write legibly on chalkboards. At Dartmouth, I have served as a TA for Math 3 (Fall 2024), Math 8 (Winter 2025 and planned Winter 2026), and Math 20 (Fall 2025), as well as a "Super TA" for Abstract Algebra (Fall 2025).


In the unlikely event that this is useful to anyone, I am leaving one line of the old home page:
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages.
